# Introduction {#sec:1}

This template formats a paper to follow the guidelines for *Institute of Physics* journals. Please see [the guidelines](https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/questions/latex-template/) for further information.

Text with citations by @cleveland1990stl or in parentheses [@HK06] and follow the Harvard system which is accepted by all IOP journals.

## Subsection title {#sec:2}

Don't forget to give each section
and subsection a unique label (see Section \ref{sec:1} for an example).

#### Paragraph headings

Use paragraph headings if needed.


# Method

## Equations

Here is an equation:
$$ 
  f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
  \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
  e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}; 
  \alpha,\beta,x > 0 .
$$
Here is another:
\begin{align}
  a^2+b^2=c^2.
\end{align}

Inline equations: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$.

If you need to use AMS fonts, set `iopams` to `true` in the header.

# Results

## Figures coming from R

Figure \ref{fig2} is generated using an R chunk.

```{r fig2, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig2}A meaningless scatterplot.", echo = FALSE}
plot(runif(25), runif(25))
```

## Tables coming from R

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in Table \ref{tab1} for example.

```{r tab1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4], 
    caption = "\\label{tab1}Caption centered above table"
)
```
