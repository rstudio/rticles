# Anonymization 

The names of all authors, affiliations, contact details, biography (optional) and the corresponding author details must be completed online as part of the submission process but should not be added to the submitted files until after editorial acceptance. Please omit information about institutions from which experimental participants were recruited or where participants were tested. Check for any other potentially identifying information. 


# Main text

The body of the submission should be structured in a logical and easy to follow manner. The text must follow the instructions in Glossa Psycholinguistics' Style sheet: See the Style Sheet below. Double-spacing is not required and tables and figures should be placed in the appropriate locations in the text.

## Subheading

You can have subheadings too!

# Abbreviations (optional) {.unnumbered}

Use abbreviations sparingly. All acronyms should be defined the first time they are used. Remember that over-use of abbreviations and acronyms will make the paper difficult to read. Manuscripts that provide glosses should list in a key all the abbreviations that are used (e.g., NOM = nominative).

# Data Accessibility (required) {.unnumbered}

A Data Accessibility Statement section must be added prior to the reference list that provides information on how to access the data and any supplemental files associated with the manuscript, including DOI. Please be sure that during the review process, data repositories are suitably anonymized. For information on how to do this at OSF, please see here: https://help.osf.io/article/155-create-a-view-only-link-for-a-registration. 

# Ethics and consent (required if applicable) {.unnumbered}

Research involving human subjects, human material, or human data, must have been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Where applicable, the studies must have been approved by an appropriate ethics committee and the authors should include a statement within the article text detailing this approval, including the name of the ethics committee and reference number of the approval. The identity of the research subject should be anonymised whenever possible. For research involving human subjects, informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from participants (or their legal guardian).

# Acknowledgements (optional){.unnumbered}

Any acknowledgements must have a header and be placed in its own paragraph, placed after the main text but before the reference list. If the research was supported by a funding grant, then please add the grant provider and grant number in the acknowledgments. Personal acknowledgements should be included only in the final version of the paper, to avoid compromising blind peer review. Editors should not be acknowledged.

# Competing interests  (required) {.unnumbered}

If any of the authors have any competing interests then these must be declared. Guidelines for competing interests can be found here. If there are no competing interests to declare then the following statement should be present: The author(s) has/have no competing interests to declare.
