# Introduction {-}

Your introduction goes here! Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

If you have a question, please use the help menu in the top right of the screen to get in touch. When your article or pre-print is complete, use the "Submit to PeerJ" button in the topbar to send your files to PeerJ.

## About PeerJ {-}

PeerJ is an award-winning open access publisher covering the biological and medical sciences.  PeerJ provides authors with three publication venues: *PeerJ* and *PeerJ Computer Science* (peer-reviewed academic journals) and *PeerJ PrePrints* (a 'pre-print server'). See https://peerj.com/about/publications/ for more information.

The PeerJ model allows an author to publish articles in their peer-reviewed journal via the purchase of a lifetime Publication Plan. Prices start from just \$99 (a one-off payment) which entitles an author to the lifetime ability to publish 1 article per year for free. Publication in PeerJ PrePrints is entirely free.

# Some \LaTeX{} Examples {-}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

## Figures and Tables {-}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table \@ref(tab:widgets), for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the project menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command as in the code for Figure \@ref(fig:view) below.

Standard \LaTeX references will work as well (e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:view}).

<!-- There are three ways to include figures: -->
<!-- 1. The LaTeX way -->
<!-- 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{view}
\caption{An example image.}
\label{fig:view}
\end{figure} 

 -->

<!-- 2. The RMarkdown way -->

```{r view, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "An example image.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("view.pdf")
```


<!-- 3. The pandoc way -->
<!-- 

![An example image. Text *can* be processed with markdown.](view.pdf){#view width = 100%}

 -->

<!-- 
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}
-->

Item     Quantity
------- ---------
Widgets        42
Gadgets        13

Table: (\#tab:widgets) An Example Table.

## Citations {-}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, like @Figueredo:2009dg, and the citep command for a citation in parentheses [@Figueredo:2009dg].

## Mathematics {-}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

## Lists {-}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

time = seq(1.5, 8, 0.1)
plot(time, sin(time), type = "l", xlab = "time [s]", ylab = "amplitude [m]", 
     cex.main = 2, col = "blue", lwd = 3, font = 2, font.main = 2)
