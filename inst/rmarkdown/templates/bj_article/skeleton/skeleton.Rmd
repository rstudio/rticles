# Introduction {-}

Your introduction goes here! Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started. Leave a blank line between blocks of text to start a new paragraph---use `\\` for separating tabular rows or hard line-breaks only. Abbreviations should be defined in the text at first mention.

Please also take note of the `\section*{...}` titles in this template: they are the required sections in a regular research Article manuscript. 

In particular, the main text of regular Articles and Computational Tools manuscripts must be structured with the following sections: **Introduction**, **Materials and Methods**, **Results**, **Discussion** (or **Results and Discussion**), **Conclusion**.

Theoretical manuscripts may include just a **Methods** section and do not require **Materials**.

No particular organization structure is required for Letters.

If your manuscript is accepted, the Biophysical production team will re-format the references for publication. *It is not necessary to format the reference list yourself to mirror the final published form.*

# Materials and Methods {-}

Capitalize trade names and give manufacturers' full names and addresses (city and state). 


## Sectioning commands {-}

Use `#` and `##` to create first- and second-level headings. 


## Figures and tables {-}


### Figures coming from R {-}

#### Normal figure embedded in text {-}

```{r fig2, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Output from `pdf()`", echo = FALSE, dev = "pdf"}
plot(runif(25) ~ runif(25))
```

\clearpage

### Tables coming from R {-}


```{r tab1, results = 'asis'}
print(xtable::xtable(head(mtcars)[,1:4], 
caption = "Caption centered under table", label = "tab1"), 
comment = FALSE, timestamp = FALSE, caption.placement = "top")
```

Table \ref{tab1} shows these numbers. Some of those numbers are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}.


# Results {-}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics:


Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CLT}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. Thus concludes the explanation about Eq.~\ref{eq:CLT}.

You can make lists with automatic numbering...

# Discussion  {-}

\LaTeX{} formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. Text with citations by @heagerty2000time, [@pepe2003statistical].

 If your manuscript is accepted, the Biophysical production team will re-format the references for publication. *It is not necessary to format the reference list yourself to mirror the final published form.*
