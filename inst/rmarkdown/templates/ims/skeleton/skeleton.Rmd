abstract: |
  The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper.
  It should be clear, descriptive, self-explanatory and not longer
  than 200 words. It should also be suitable for publication in
  abstracting services. Formulas should be used as sparingly as
  possible within the abstract. The abstract should not make
  reference to results, bibliography or formulas in the body
  of the paper---it should be self-contained.

  This is a sample input file.  Comparing it with the output it
  generates can show you how to produce a simple document of
  your own.

# Introduction
This template helps you to create a properly formatted \LaTeXe\ manuscript.
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %% `\ ' is used here because TeX ignores    %% -->
<!-- %% spaces after text commands.              %% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
Prepare your paper in the same style as used in this sample .pdf file.
Try to avoid excessive use of italics and bold face.
Please do not use any \LaTeXe\ or \TeX\ commands that affect the layout
or formatting of your document (i.e., commands like \verb|\textheight|,
\verb|\textwidth|, etc.).

# Section headings

Here are some sub-sections:

## A sub-section

Regular text.

### A sub-sub-section

Regular text.

# Text

## Lists

The following is an example of an *itemized* list, two levels deep.
 
* This is the first item of an itemized list.  Each item
  in the list is marked with a "tick." The document
  style determines what kind of tick mark is used.
* This is the second item of the list.  It contains another
  list nested inside it.

  - This is the first item of an itemized list that
    is nested within the itemized list.
  - This is the second item of the inner list.  \LaTeX\
    allows you to nest lists deeper than you really should.

  This is the rest of the second item of the outer list.
- This is the third item of the list.

The following is an example of an *enumerated* list of one level.

\begin{longlist}
\item This is the first item of an enumerated list.
\item This is the second item of an enumerated list.
\end{longlist}

The following is an example of an *enumerated* list, two levels deep.
\begin{longlist}
\item[1.]
This is the first item of an enumerated list.  Each item
in the list is marked with a ``tick.''.  The document
style determines what kind of tick mark is used.
\item[2.]
This is the second item of the list.  It contains another
list nested inside of it.
\begin{longlist}
\item
This is the first item of an enumerated list that
is nested within.  
\item
This is the second item of the inner list.  \LaTeX\
allows you to nest lists deeper than you really should.
\end{longlist}
This is the rest of the second item of the outer list.
\item[3.]
This is the third item of the list.
\end{longlist}

## Punctuation

Dashes come in three sizes: a hyphen, an intra-word dash like "$U$-statistics" or "the time-homogeneous model";
a medium dash (also called an "en-dash") for number ranges or between two equal entities like "1--2" or "Cauchy--Schwarz inequality";
and a punctuation dash (also called an "em-dash") in place of a comma, semicolon,
colon or parentheses---like this.

Generating an ellipsis \ldots\ with the right spacing
around the periods requires a special command.

# Fonts

Please use text fonts in text mode, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]\textrm{Roman}
\item[]\textit{Italic}
\item[]\textbf{Bold}
\item[]\textsc{Small Caps}
\item[]\textsf{Sans serif}
\item[]\texttt{Typewriter}
\end{itemize}
Please use mathematical fonts in mathematical mode, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] $\mathrm{ABCabc123}$
\item[] $\mathit{ABCabc123}$
\item[] $\mathbf{ABCabc123}$
\item[] $\boldsymbol{ABCabc123\alpha\beta\gamma}$
\item[] $\mathcal{ABC}$
\item[] $\mathbb{ABC}$
\item[] $\mathsf{ABCabc123}$
\item[] $\mathtt{ABCabc123}$
\item[] $\mathfrak{ABCabc123}$
\end{itemize}
Note that \verb|\mathcal, \mathbb| belongs to capital letters-only font typefaces.

# Notes

Footnotes[^1]
pose no problem.\footnote{Note that footnote number is after punctuation.}

[^1]: This is an example of a footnote.

# Quotations

Text is displayed by indenting it from the left margin. There are short quotations

> This is a short quotation.  It consists of a
> single paragraph of text.  There is no paragraph
> indentation.

and longer ones.

::: {.quotation latex=1}
This is a longer quotation.  It consists of two paragraphs
of text.  The beginning of each paragraph is indicated
by an extra indentation.

This is the second paragraph of the quotation.  It is just
as dull as the first paragraph.

# Environments

## Examples for *`plain`-style environments*
\begin{axiom}\label{ax1}
This is the body of Axiom \ref{ax1}.
\end{axiom}

\begin{proof}
This is the body of the proof of the axiom above.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}\label{cl1}
This is the body of Claim \ref{cl1}. Claim \ref{cl1} is numbered after
Axiom \ref{ax1} because we used \verb|[axiom]| in \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{claim}

\begin{theorem}\label{th1}
This is the body of Theorem \ref{th1}. Theorem \ref{th1} numbering is
dependent on section because we used \verb|[section]| after \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Title of the theorem]\label{th2}
This is the body of Theorem \ref{th2}. Theorem \ref{th2} has additional title.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}\label{le1}
This is the body of Lemma \ref{le1}. Lemma \ref{le1} is numbered after
Theorem \ref{th2} because we used \verb|[theorem]| in \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{le1}]
This is the body of the proof of Lemma \ref{le1}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Examples for \emph{\texttt{remark}}-style environments}
\begin{definition}\label{de1}
This is the body of Definition \ref{de1}. Definition \ref{de1} is numbered after
Lemma \ref{le1} because we used \verb|[theorem]| in \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
This is the body of the example. Example is unnumbered because we used \verb|\newtheorem*|
instead of \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{example}

\begin{fact}
This is the body of the fact. Fact is unnumbered because we used \verb|\newtheorem*|
instead of \verb|\newtheorem|.
\end{fact}

# Equations and the like

Two equations:
\begin{equation}
    C_{s}  =  K_{M} \frac{\mu/\mu_{x}}{1-\mu/\mu_{x}} \label{ccs}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    G = \frac{P_{\mathrm{opt}} - P_{\mathrm{ref}}}{P_{\mathrm{ref}}}  100(\%).
\end{equation}

Equation arrays:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dS}{dt} & = & - \sigma X + s_{F} F,\\
  \frac{dX}{dt} & = &   \mu    X,\\
  \frac{dP}{dt} & = &   \pi    X - k_{h} P,\\
  \frac{dV}{dt} & = &   F.
\end{eqnarray}
One long equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mu_{\text{normal}} & = & \mu_{x} \frac{C_{s}}{K_{x}C_{x}+C_{s}}  \nonumber\\
                     & = & \mu_{\text{normal}} - Y_{x/s}\bigl(1-H(C_{s})\bigr)(m_{s}+\pi /Y_{p/s})\\
                     & = & \mu_{\text{normal}}/Y_{x/s}+ H(C_{s}) (m_{s}+ \pi /Y_{p/s}).\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
