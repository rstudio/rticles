Suggested section heads

# Introduction

The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided into sections, each with its own heading.

Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a lowercase letter or number. Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are three or fewer letters).

# Materials and Methods

Here is text on Materials and Methods.

Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay. Use #. for list for a cleaner LaTeX output.

#. First element

#. Second element

## A descriptive heading about methods

Please use ONLY \\citet and \\citep for reference citations.
DO NOT use other cite commands (e.g., \\cite, \\citeyear, \\nocite, \\citealp, etc.).
Example \\citet and \\citep:
  ...as shown by \citet{Levitus2012}, \citet{Nuncio2011} and \citet{Raphael2004}
  ...as shown by \citep{Levitus2012}, \citep{Nuncio2011}, \citep{Raphael2004}.
  ...has been shown \citep[e.g.,][]{Levitus2012, Nuncio2011, Raphael2004}.

# Data

Or section title might be a descriptive heading about data

As of 2018 we recommend use of the TrackChanges package to mark revisions. The trackchanges package adds five new LaTeX commands:

\\note[editor]{The note}

\\annote[editor]{Text to annotate}{The note}

\\add[editor]{Text to add}

\\remove[editor]{Text to remove}

\\change[editor]{Text to remove}{Text to add}

complete documentation is here: http://trackchanges.sourceforge.net/

# Results

Or section title might be a descriptive heading about the results

Enter Figures and Tables near as possible to where they are first mentioned:
DO NOT USE \\psfrag or \\subfigure commands.
DO NOT USE \\newcommand, \\renewcommand, or \\def, etc.

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

Example table

\begin{table}
 \caption{Time of the Transition Between Phase 1 and Phase 2$^{a}$}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{l c}
 \hline
  Run  & Time (min)  \\
 \hline
   $l1$  & 260   \\
   $l2$  & 300   \\
   $l3$  & 340   \\
   $h1$  & 270   \\
   $h2$  & 250   \\
   $h3$  & 380   \\
   $r1$  & 370   \\
   $r2$  & 390   \\
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{l}{$^{a}$Footnote text here.}
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

AGU prefers the use of {sidewaystable} over {landscapetable} as it causes fewer problems.

```{r, fig.env = "sidewaysfigure"}
plot(pressure)
```

\begin{sidewaystable}
\caption{Caption here}
\label{tab:signif_gap_clos}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
one&two&three\\
four&five&six
\end{tabular}
\end{sidewaystable}

If using numbered lines, please surround equations with \\begin{linenomath\*}... \\end{linenomath\*}

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
y|{f} \sim g(m, \sigma)
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\notation{$e=mc^2$}
Equation in German-born physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special
relativity that showed that the increased relativistic mass ($m$) of a
body comes from the energy of motion of the body—that is, its kinetic
energy ($E$)—divided by the speed of light squared ($c^2$).
