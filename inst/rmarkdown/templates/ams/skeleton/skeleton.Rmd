# Introduction

It has now become our basic knowledge that the extratropical atmosphere is
driven strongly by the horizontal potential temperature gradient that arises
from the differential solar heating (e.g., Lorenz 1955). The horizontal gradient
in the potential temperature, often referred to as baroclinicity, is a measure
of upper-level wind steering via thermal wind and a measure of baroclinic
instability in the atmosphere. Baroclinicity in the lower atmosphere in classic
theories of atmospheric stability is measured by a combination of the static
stability and horizontal temperature gradient, the latter of which is equivalent
to vertical shear in the horizontal wind through the thermal wind balance
(Charney 1947; Eady 1949). In its original form, the Eady's maximum growth rate
for baroclinic instability $B_{GRMax}$ is defined by $B_{GRMax} = 0.31(|f|/N)(\partial U/\partial_z)$ 
in a zonally homogeneous steady mean state, where $U$ is the mean zonal flow, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $N$ is the
`Brunt--V\"ais\"al\"a`{=latex} frequency. Charney's formula is slightly different from the
Eady's, but still incorporates the same effects (Table \ref{t1}).

Lindzen and Farrell (1980) first applied the Eady's parameter to atmospheric
data to successfully estimate the maximum growth rate of baroclinic instability
in the troposphere. Hoskins and Valdes (1990) used its localized version (i.e.,
$U$, $N$, and $f$ are all local Eulerian mean values) as the central parameter
in their study of the Northern Hemispheric storm tracks. This local version, or
its simplified version, has been used successfully as an indicator of baroclinic
wave generation in diagnostic studies of stormtracks in recent years as well
(Nakamura and Sampe 2002; Nakamura and Shimpo 2004; Nakamura et al. 2004). In
our study, the North Atlantic part of which was reported in Nakamura and Yamane
(2009, hereafter Part I), we define the near-surface baroclinic vector,
$\mathbf{B}=B^x\mathbf{i} + B^y\mathbf{j}$, where 
$B^x= -(g/\theta N)(\partial\theta/\partial y)$ and $B^y = (g/\theta N)(\partial\theta/\partial x)$
with $\theta$ being the monthly-mean potential temperature at 2 m above the
surface, and use it as the central quantity of the diagnoses. Unless stated
otherwise, ``anomalies'' refer to deviations from the climatology hereafter.
Though its meridional component does not appear in any classic theory of
baroclinic instability, a theory that does incorporate the effect of $B^y$ shows
its important role in enhancing baroclinic wave generation locally to the east
of the mean trough (Niehaus 1980). In the North Atlantic storm track region, we
indeed found that the substantial zonal gradient in the surface temperature in
and around the Labrador Sea plays a major role in the large-scale atmospheric
state.

# The sea surface temperature

The sea surface temperature (SST) is an important factor in determining
$\mathbf{B}$ in the storm-track regions (e.g., Hoskins and Valdes 1990; Nakamura
et al. 2004; Part I). SST anomalies (SSTAs) around an oceanic front along the
Gulf Stream (GS), Kuroshio Extension (KE), or Oyashio Extension (OE) can have a
profound impact on $\mathbf{B}$ along the storm tracks.

## A subtle point

A subtle but important point that has to be considered carefully in this regard
is the spatial scale and the location of SSTAs with respect to the climatology,
since it is the anomalous surface temperature gradient whose structure has a
spatial scale of the atmospheric Rossby deformation radius that can exert
significant influence on the large-scale atmospheric flow.

### Changes in the temperature

The high sensitivity of $\mathbf{B}$ to changes in the temperature contrast
across the front and changes in the width of the front, and the uncertainty in
the impact of SSTAs of small spatial scales on $\mathbf{B}$ make it difficult to
assess the effective B anomalies that are attributable to the SSTAs from the
available data. Moreover, it is uncertain exactly how the SSTAs in the presence
or absence of the land surface temperature anomalies may or may not produce
$\mathbf{B}$ anomalies that are significant to the atmosphere.

#### Complicating factor

The complicating factor introduced by the land surface must be taken into
account when studying potential roles of extratropical SSTAs in the
extratropical atmospheric anomalies.
Lau (1988) investigated patterns of anomalous storm track activity and
associated low-frequency flow anomalies by computing empirical orthogonal
functions (EOFs) for high-frequency 500-hPa geopotential height for the Northern
Hemisphere winters. He found that both North Atlantic and North Pacific storm
tracks have a pattern of meridional shift and a pattern of increased or
decreased eddy activity in the first two EOFs.He also found that these changes
in the storm tracks have symbiotic relationships with the background flows and
have substantial impacts on the mean flow. Part I approached the issue of the
stormtrack and low-frequency flow variability in connection with SSTAs in the
extratropics, focusing on $\mathbf{B}$ as the key parameter of diagnoses, and
found similar patterns of variability in the eddy activity and low-frequency
flow in the North Atlantic basin. Much of this variability was connected to
SSTAs in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream in cold months (Part I). Since the
winter North Pacific basin has a storm track andmean flow that appear to be
related to the oceanic fronts, Kuroshio--Oyashio Extensions (KOE) in this case,
in a manner essentially the same as those in the North Atlantic basin related to
the GS,we have attempted to find similar results for the North Pacific basin. In
this regard, we have chosen not to project our results onto the major mode of
variability in the extratropical North Pacific basin, the North Pacific decadal
variability (PDV), so that our presentation and discussion are mostly confined
to the wave--mean flow dynamics of monthly time scale or shorter.


Our approach to the search for a link between anomalies in the KOE and the
overlying atmosphere is as follows: (i) identify dominant patterns in anomalous
$\mathbf{B}$ in the storm track for each calendarmonth and identify years in
which the anomaly fits the pattern well, (ii) composite anomalies in the
monthly-mean circulation and highfrequency transients in the atmosphere to
obtain a typical atmospheric state that accompanies the patterns of anomalous
$\mathbf B$, (iii) composite SSTA to obtain a typical oceanic state that
accompanies and precedes the patterns of anomalous $\mathbf B$, and (iv)
composite anomalous net surface heat flux that accompanies and precedes the
pattern of anomalous $\mathbf B$. With this approach, we obtain typical pictures
of anomalous states in the atmosphere and oceans with anomalous $\mathbf{B}$ as
their connecting interface. Section 2 describes the data and procedure to
compute $\mathbf B$. Section 3 describes the climatology and variance of
$\mathbf B$. Dominant patterns of $\mathbf B$ are shown in section 4, followed
by composited anomalies in various atmospheric fields and SST in section 5.
Finally, we present our discussion on the results, examining a potential
cause--effect relationship between anomalies in the SST and atmosphere in
section 6.

Figure \ref{fig1} shows the climatology of $Bx$, $U^{200}$,
$\overline{V'\theta'}^{850}$, $\overline{V'\theta'}^{200}$, $MR^{z850}$,
$U^{1000}$, SST, and $F_h$ for February and August as examples of the reference
state in the winter and summer. The numeric superscript indicates the pressure
level in hPa. The seasonal mean is visibly more diffused in structure,
particularly for Bx, than those shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}. There are no surprises
in the overall picture of Bx. The regions of large land--sea temperature
contrast and the oceanic fronts show very large Bx in cold months. The position
of Bx maximum in the storm track region is found along theKOEregion throughout
the year. The zonally elongated band of large Bx in the storm track is generally
wider in cold months than in warm months. In fact, large Bx values that
presumably accompany the Kuroshio and its extension in the cold months vanish in
the summer (Figs. \ref{fig1}a,b). The seasonal variation in the Bx values in the
storm track basically follows that of the north--south differential
heating--largest in the winter and smallest in the summer. As reported by
Nakamura et al. (2004), the $U^{200}$ maximum is displaced southward from the Bx
maximum visibly in winter months (Fig. \ref{fig2}a), although U200 is generally
large over the area of large Bx in the core of the storm track. The southward
displacement of the U200 maximum from the Bx maximum in the storm track is less
pronounced or even reversed in warmer months (Fig. \ref{fig2}b). We note that
the structure of the climatological Bx generally reflects those of
($\partial{\theta^{2{\textrm m}}}/\partial{y}$) with some exceptions where the
surface slope contributes significantly to Bx in isolated areas over the land,
most notably around the Himalayas.

The position and structure of the storm track as indicated by
$\overline{V'\theta'}^{850}$ and $\overline{V'V'}^{200}$ are, at least for the
winter, essentially the same as those reported in earlier studies on the storm
tracks (e.g., Chang et al. 2002). The maxima in $\overline{V'\theta'}^{850}$ and
$\overline{V'V'}^{200}$ are located in the band of large Bx.


# Data and calculation procedures

The data used to calculate $\mathbf{B}$ are the monthly-mean temperature at 2 m
above the surface ($T^{2m}$) and temperature at pressure levels available from
the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis
(ERA-40; Uppala et al.~2005). We chose the ERA-40 $T^{2m}$ data rather than the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction--National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCEP--NCAR) reanalysis products for its explicit inclusion of the
observed near-surface temperature in producing the $T^{2m}$ data. The
monthly-mean surface pressure data from the NCEP--NCAR reanalyses (Kalnay et al.
1996) were used to determine the pressure levels to be used for $\mathbf B$
calculation, and to calculate $\theta$ at 2 m above the surface from $T^{2m}$.
We used the NCEP--NCAR surface pressure data for convenience, since we had
already compiled the dataset for calculating transient eddy fluxes to be
mentioned later and the ERA-40 surface pressure data are not readily available.
We later compared the NCEP--NCAR monthly-mean sea level pressure with that of
ERA-40, and found the difference between the two products to be immaterial for
the purpose of the current study. We also used ERA-40 monthly-mean horizontal
wind and geopotential height at pressure levels, net surface heat flux, Fh (the
sum of latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, solar radiation, and the thermal
radiation), and Hadley Centre sea surface temperature data (Rayner et al. 2003)
to compile anomaly composites accompanying anomalous patterns in $\mathbf B$. In
addition, we used 6-hourly temperature and wind data from the NCEP--NCAR
reanalyses to compute various eddy fields. The accuracy of the Fh data used here
is, as true for other reanalyses surface heat flux products, may not be so high
to produce reliable anomaly composites.


We computed $\mathbf{B}$ near the surface by calculating the horizontal gradient
in $\theta^{2{\textrm m}}$, using the centered finite differencing, and
calculating $N$ from the lowest three vertical pressure levels that are location
dependent because of topography. Both $\nabla\theta^{2{\textrm m}}$ and $N$ were
calculated locally as in Hoskins and Valdes (1990) and Nakamura and Shimpo
(2004). The entire 45 yr from September 1957 to August 2002 were used for the
Northern Hemisphere. To resolve the dominant modes in $\mathbf{B}$ arising from
the land--sea temperature contrast, one may need much higher horizontal
resolution in the data. The relatively coarse horizontal resolution of the data
may artificially suppress the significance of the variability associated with
the land--sea temperature contrast.One should keep this limitation in mind. The
6-hourly bandpassed (period of 2--7 days) eddy fields and ultra-low-frequency
(period of 30 days and longer) background fields were computed from the NCEP--
NCAR reanalyses, using simple time filters (Lau and Lau 1984) first. The
filtered time series were then visually examined against the raw time series
and, then, used to calculate the slowly evolving bandpassed meridional velocity
variance ($\overline{V'V'}$), meridional temperature flux
($\overline{V'\theta'}$), and the three-dimensional transient wave activity flux
defined on a zonally varying basic state by Plumb (1986). The wave activity flux
consists of the zonal and meridional advective fluxes (MU and MV), the zonal and
meridional radiative fluxes (MRx and MRy), and the radiative vertical flux
(MRz). The flux is essentially the Eliassen--Palm flux (Eliassen and Palm 1961)
in a zonally inhomogeneous mean flow (Plumb 1986). The wave activity flux was
calculated from February 1948 to November 2004 only for the extratropics
poleward of 208 latitude. Also, it was calculated only from 850 to 30 hPa
because of the double differentiation with respect to pressure required for the
calculation. The flux of particular interest in this study is the vertical
component. Here MR$^z$ is defined by

$$
MR^z=
\frac{
pf \cos\phi}
{p^0|\nabla h\bar q|(d\theta_0/dz)}
\left(\frac{\partial\bar q}{\partial x}
\overline{U'\theta'} +
\frac{\partial\bar q}{\partial y}
\overline{V'\theta'}\right), 
$$

where $q$ is quasigeostrophic potential vorticity, $p$ is the pressure, $p^0$ is
the reference surface pressure set to 1000 hPa here, $\theta_0$ is the
area-weighted ultra-low-frequency hemispheric mean potential temperature at each
height, u9 is the bandpassed potential temperature, and z is the geopotential
height. An overbar denotes an ultra-low frequency component and a prime denotes
bandpassed component. The 6-hourly time series of wave fluxes was computed by
using the time series of ultra-low-frequency fields as the basic-state and
high-frequency fields as eddies. In short, the time series was calculated by
changing the meaning of an overbar from the time mean state to an
ultra-low-frequency state, and changing the meaning of a prime from a departure
from the mean to a high-frequency state. The 6-hourly eddy time series was
averaged over each month to produce monthly-mean time series. This dataset
allows us to examine anomalous eddy fields accompanying anomalous $\mathbf B$ in
specific months. The climatology for the eddy fields was computed from 46 yr,
January 1958 to December 2003. The calculation of the wave activity and its flux
is described in detail by Nakamura et al. (2010).


# Climatology and variance

The climatology and variance of $Bx$ and $By$ were computed for each calendar
month and examined closely for their spatial and temporal structures. The
monthly climatology, rather than the seasonal climatology, is used as the
reference in our study, to avoid contamination of the diagnostic results arising
from differences in the climatology between two successive months. Unlike in the
North Atlantic basin reported in Part I, we found the impact of $By$ variations
on the large-scale atmospheric state in the North Pacific basin much weaker than
that of Bx variations, presumably because of themore zonal orientation of the
KOE in comparison to the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Current. In the
following, thus, we focus our presentation on the climatology and variations of
$Bx$ and their impact on the large-scale atmospheric state.
