%
%\statement
%	 Enter significance statement here, no more than 120 words. See \url{www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/author-information/significance-statements/} for details.

%$if(twocol)$\twocolsig$else$\statement$endif$
$statement$
$endif$ % FIXME, AMS template says to use twocolsig instead of sig for twocol, but there is no sig, is two col twocolstatement or twocolsig?

%% Capsule (BAMS only)
%%
%\capsule
%       Enter BAMS capsule here, no more than 30 words. See \url{www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/author-information/formatting-and-manuscript-components/#capsule} for details.
