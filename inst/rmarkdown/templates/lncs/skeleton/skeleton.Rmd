# First Section

## A Subsection Sample

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is not indented. 
The first paragraph that follows a table, figure, equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

### Sample Heading (Third Level)

Only two levels of headings should be numbered. 
Lower level headings remain unnumbered; they are formatted as run-in headings.

#### Sample Heading (Fourth Level)

The contribution should contain no more than four levels of headings. 
Table\ \ref{tab:table} gives a summary of all heading levels.

```{r table}
knitr::kable(head(pressure), 
             format = "latex",
             caption = "Table captions should be placed above the tables.")
```

\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate line.

\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and schemas. 
Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see Fig.\ \ref{fig:fig1}).

```{r fig1, fig.cap = "A figure caption is always placed below the illustration. Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are justified by the macro package automatically."}
plot(pressure)
```

::: {.theorem latex=true}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas, propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
:::

The environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary', 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

::: {.proof latex=true}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics, while the following text appears in normal font.
:::

For citations of references, use\ \cite{Nuncio2011}.
Multiple citations are grouped\ \cite{Levitus2012,Raphael2004}.

### Acknowledgements
Please place your acknowledgments at the end of the paper, preceded by an unnumbered run-in heading (i.e. 3rd-level heading).
