# First Section

## A Subsection Sample

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is not indented. 
The first paragraph that follows a table, figure, equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

### Sample Heading (Third Level)

Only two levels of headings should be numbered. 
Lower level headings remain unnumbered; they are formatted as run-in headings.

#### Sample Heading (Fourth Level)

The contribution should contain no more than four levels of headings. 
Table\ \ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate line.

\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and schemas. 
Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see Fig.\ \ref{fig1}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1.eps}
\caption{A figure caption is always placed below the illustration.
Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas, propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}

The environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary', 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics, while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}   
For citations of references, use\ \cite{Nuncio2011}.
Multiple citations are grouped\ \cite{Levitus2012,Raphael2004}.

### Acknowledgements
Please place your acknowledgments at the end of the paper, preceded by an unnumbered run-in heading (i.e. 3rd-level heading).
