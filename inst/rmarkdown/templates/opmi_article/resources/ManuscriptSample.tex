\section{Track Changes}
These tracking commands allow copyeditors to mark text so
that the author can consider whether he/she wants to make
the change. In the manuscript version of the article, 
a list of changes will automatically appear at the end of the
article, as you see here.

The comments will be seen when
\verb+\documentclass[manuscript]{stjour}+
is used, but will disappear in the final version,
leaving only the suggested change.

Thus, if the author doesn't like the change, he/she should
delete it before resubmitting his/her manuscript.

These commands are used:
\begin{verbatim}
\added{}
\deleted{}
\replaced{}{}
\explained{}
\end{verbatim}

Here is some text to illustrate the track changes
commands, quotes (with apologies) from Albert Einstein:

\begin{quotation}
Two things are \replaced{almost infinite}{infinite}\explain{`almost'
detracts from the strength of the statement}: the universe and
human stupidity;  and I'm not sure about the universe.

The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is
the source of all true art and science. \added{-- Albert Einstein}

It is the \added{supreme} art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative
expression and knowledge.
\end{quotation}
