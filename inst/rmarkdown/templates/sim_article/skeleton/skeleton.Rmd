# Introduction

Many authors submitting to research journals use \LaTeX to prepare their papers. This paper describes the `simauth.cls` class file which can be used to convert articles produced with other \LaTeX class files into the correct form for publication in _Statistics in Medicine_.

The `simauth.cls` class file preserves much of the standard \LaTeX interface so that any document which was produced using the standard \LaTeX `article` style can easily be converted to work with the `simauth` style. However, the width of text and typesize will vary from that of `article.cls`; therefore, _line breaks will change_
and it is likely that displayed mathematics and tabular material will need re-setting.

In the following sections we describe how to lay out your code to use `simauth.cls` to reproduce the typographical look of _Statistics in Medicine_. However, this paper is not a guide to using \LaTeX and we would refer you to any of the many books available (see, for example, [@R1; @R2; @R3]).

# The Three Golden Rules
Before we proceed, we would like to stress _three golden rules_ that need to be followed to enable the most efficient use of your code at the typesetting stage:

1. keep your own macros to an absolute minimum;

2. as `TeX` is designed to make sensible spacing decisions by itself, do _not_ use explicit horizontal or vertical spacing commands, except in a few accepted (mostly
mathematical) situations, such as `\,` before a differential~d, or `\quad` to separate an equation from its qualifier;

3. follow the _Statistics in Medicine_ reference style.

# Getting Started

The `simauth` class file should run on any standard \LaTeX installation. If any of the fonts, class files or packages it requires are missing from your installation,
they can be found on the _TeX Collection_ DVDs or from CTAN.

Details on Rmarkdown can be found online [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](here).

_Statistics in Medicine_ is published using Times fonts and this is achieved by using the `times` option as `\documentclass[times]{simauth}`. Times fonts are also used for mathematics. This is achieved by adding the \LaTeX package `mathtime`. Being `mathtime` not available on \TeX Live installations, the default template does not include it. If you need/want to re-enable it, add the option `keep_tex: TRUE` to the YAML header as follows and edit the resulting `.tex`  file manually.

```
output:
  rticles::sim_article:
    keep_tex: TRUE
```

If for any reason you have a problem using Times you can easily resort to Computer Modern fonts by removing the `times` option.

# The Article Header Information

Configure the YAML header including the following elements:

* `title`: Title

* `author`: Author(s) information, as a string, see below

* `address`: List containing `address` and `num` for defining `author` affiliations

* `corraddr`: Corresponding author address

* `authabbr`: Short author list for header

* `date`: Date of submission

* `year`: Year of submission

* `abstract`: Limited to 250 words

* `keywords`: Up to 6 keywords

* `bibliography`: Bibtex `.bib` file

## Author information

In order to obtain better results, author(s) information should be provided as a string with \LaTeX elements:

```
author: "A.U. Thor\\affilnum{a,b}, O. Tro\\affilnum{b} and O. Vriga\\affilnum{c}"
```

## Remarks

1. In `authabbr` use _et al._ if there are three or more authors.

2. Note the use of `affilnum` and `num` to link names and addresses. The author for correspondence can be marked via a custom `address` entry and `corraddr` is used to give that author's address, which will be printed as a footnote, prefaced by
_Correspondence to:_.

3. For submitting a double-spaced manuscript, add `doublespace` as an option to a `classoption` line in the YAML header: `classoption: doublespace`.

4. Use `\cgs` for giving details of financial sponsors. These details will be printed as a footnote, with _Contract/grant sponsor:_ inserted in the appropriate places. This has to be implemented using \LaTeX, and not Rmarkdown.

5. The abstract should be capable of standing by itself, in the absence of the body of the article and of the bibliography. Therefore, it must not contain any reference citations.

6. Keywords are separated by semicolons.

# The Body of the Article

## Mathematics

`simauth.cls` makes the full functionality of `AmS/TeX` available. We encourage the use of the `align`, `gather` and `multline` environments for displayed mathematics.

Use mathematics in Rmarkdown as usual.

## Figures and Tables

`simauth.cls` uses the `graphicx` package for handling figures.

Figures are supported from R code too:

```{r plot_ref, fig.cap = "Fancy Caption\\label{fig:plot}"}
x = rnorm(10)
y = rnorm(10)
plot(x, y)
```

...and can be referenced: \ref{fig:plot}. It is a quirky hack at the moment, see [https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/323](here).

Analogously, use Rmarkdown to produce tables as usual:

```{r, results = "asis"}
library(xtable)
xtable(head(cars), caption = "A table", label = "tab:table")
```

Referenced via \ref{tab:table}.

## Cross-referencing

The use of the Rmarkdown equivalent of the \LaTeX cross-reference system
for figures, tables, equations, etc., is encouraged (using `[@<name>]`, equivalent of `\ref{<name>}` and `\label{<name>}`). That works well for citations in Rmarkdown, not so well for figures and tables. In that case, it is possible to revert to standard \LaTeX syntax.

Example: [@pepe2003statistical; @zou2005regularization].

## Acknowledgements

An Acknowledgements section is started with `\ack` or `\acks` for _Acknowledgement_ or _Acknowledgements_, respectively. It must be placed just before the References. Define the content of the acknowledgment section in the YAML header.

## Bibliography

Link a `.bib` document via the YAML header, and bibliography will be printed at the very end (as usual). Remember to include a `#Bibliography` section.

The default bibliography style is provided by Wiley as in `wileyj.bst`. It is possible to provide a custom style by providing a `.csl`/`.bst` in the `bibliographystyle` field of the YAML header.  

## Double Spacing

If you need to double space your document for submission please use the `doublespace` option in the header.
