Introduction
=============
This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for CVPR conference papers produced under \LaTeX\ using cvpr2020AuthorKit (cvpr2020.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/cvpr2020AuthorKit.tar).

## Unpublished work
If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time,
which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that
submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you
had previously published related work.  In such cases, include the
anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as additional material and
cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324,
Supplied as additional material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
