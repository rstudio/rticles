               series forecasts. The methods used in the M-competition as well
               as the M3-competition, and many of the measures recommended by
               previous authors on this topic, are found to be degenerate in
               commonly occurring situations. Instead, we propose that the mean

               forecast accuracy across multiple time series.",
