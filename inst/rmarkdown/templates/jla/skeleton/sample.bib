  abstract = {The call for science curriculum reform has been made over and over
	again for much of the twentieth century. Arguments have been made
	that the content of the curriculum is not appropriate for meeting
	the individual and social needs of people living in the modern world;
	that the curriculum has become overstuffed with topics and does not
	serve students especially well; and above all, that the curriculum
	does not generate the student learning it is expected to produce.
	The latest volume in a continuing series of publications from the
	{AAAS} designed to reform science education, Designs for Science
	Literacy presupposes that curriculum reform must be considerably
	more extensive and fundamental than the tinkering with individual
	courses and subjects that has been going on for decades. Designs
	deals with the critical issues involved in assembling sound instructional
	materials into a new, coherent K-12 whole. The book pays special
	attention to the need to link science-oriented studies to the arts
	and humanities, and also proposes how to align the curriculum with
	an established set of learning goals while preserving the American
	tradition of local responsibility for the curriculum itself. If fundamental
	curriculum reform is ever to occur, a new process for creating alternatives
	will have to be developed. Designs for Science Literacy provides
	the groundwork for such a process.},
