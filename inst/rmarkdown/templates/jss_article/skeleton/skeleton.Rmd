# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic LaTeX that you need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

In general, don't use Markdown, but use the more precise LaTeX commands instead:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}

One exception is inline code, which can be written inside a pair of backticks (i.e., using the Markdown syntax).

If you want to use LaTeX commands in headers, you need to provide a `short-title` attribute. You can also provide a custom identifier if necessary. See the header of Section \ref{r-code} for example.

# \proglang{R} code {short-title="R code" #r-code}

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

## Features specific to \pkg{rticles} {short-title="Features specific to rticles"}

* Adding short titles to section headers is a feature specific to \pkg{rticles} (implemented via a Pandoc Lua filter). This feature is currently not supported by Pandoc and we will update this template if [it is officially supported in the future](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4409).
* Using the `\AND` syntax in the `author` field to add authors on a new line. This is a specific to the `rticles::jss_article` format.
