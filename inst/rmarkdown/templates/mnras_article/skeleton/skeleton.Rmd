  The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
  It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
  No references should appear in the abstract.

# Introduction

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.  See
`mnras_sample.tex` for a more complex example, and `mnras_guide.tex` for a full
user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by @Others2013,
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve @Author2012.

# Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.  It is
frequently split into subsections, such as Section \ref{maths} below.

## Maths

Labels are auto--generated, i.e. this one has `\label{maths}`.

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$ km s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered as
a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
  x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
  \label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation (\ref{eq:quadratic}).

## Figures and tables

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig. \ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table \ref{tab:example_table}.

\begin{figure}
  % To include a figure from a file named example.*
  % Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
  % or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
  Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
  but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
  Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
  \label{tab:example_table}
  \begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
    \hline
    A & B & C & D\\
    \hline
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
    2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
    3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

# Conclusions

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and
describe the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

# Acknowledgements {-}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.

# References {-}

<div id="refs"></div>

\appendix

# Some extra material

If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the flow of the
main paper, it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of
references.
