# Citations

The code `[@key]` should usually be used for making
citations surrounded by parentheses, where `key` is the BibTeX cite-key.
If you need only the year in parentheses, you may use `@key`.

Some examples:

- Normal journal cite: [@joursamp1]

- Volume number with issue number: [@joursamp3]

- Journal article published online, not yet printed: [published
online, @sampMisc2]

- Book reference: [@booksamp1]

- In press: [in press, @inpress2]

- Website: [@websiteauthyear]

- Inproceedings: [@sampinproceedings3].

<!-- Use \appendix* for only one appendix section. -->
\appendix 

To start the appendix, use the `\appendix` command.
This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes
instead of regular sections. Therefore, the `\appendix` command
should be used only once---to set up the section commands to act as
appendices. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading
for a section can be left empty. For example,

```latex
\appendix

# 
```

will produce an appendix heading that says "APPENDIX A" and

```latex
\appendix

# Background
```

will produce an appendix heading that says "APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND"
(note that the colon is set automatically).

If there is only one appendix, then the letter "A" should not
appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix
command (`\appendix*` in the place of `\appendix`).

# A little more on appendices

Observe that this appendix was started by using

```markdown
# A little more on appendices
```

Note the equation number in an appendix:

$$E=mc^2$$
