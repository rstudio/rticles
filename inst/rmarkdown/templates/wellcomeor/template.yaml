 Template for creating an article for submission to Wellcome Open Research

 Please list all authors that played a significant role in the research involved
 in the article. Please provide full affiliation information (including full
 institutional address, ZIP code and e-mail address) for all authors, and
 identify who is/are the corresponding author(s).

 References can be listed in any standard referencing style that uses a
 numbering system(i.e. not Harvard referencing style), and should be consistent
 between references within a given article.

 Reference management systems such as Zotero provide options for exporting
 bibliographies as Bib\TeX{} files. Bib\TeX{} is a bibliographic tool that is
 used with \LaTeX{} to help organize the user's references and create a
 bibliography. This template contains an example of such a file,
 \texttt{sample.bib}, which can be replaced with your own. Use the \verb|\cite|
 command  to create in-text citations, like this \cite{Smith:2012qr} and this
 \cite{Smith:2013jd}.
