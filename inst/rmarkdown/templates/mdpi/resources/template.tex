% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.
