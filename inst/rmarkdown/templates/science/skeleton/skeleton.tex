\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this file, we present some tips and sample mark-up to assure your
\LaTeX~file of the smoothest possible journey from review manuscript to
published \{\it Science\/\} paper. We focus here particularly on issues
related to style files, citation, and math, tables, and figures, as
those tend to be the biggest sticking points. Please use the source file
for this document, \texttt{scifile.tex}, as a template for your
manuscript, cutting and pasting your content into the file at the
appropriate places.

\{\it Science\/\}'s publication workflow relies on Microsoft Word. To
translate \LaTeX~files into Word, we use an intermediate MS-DOS routine
\cite{tth} that converts the \TeX~source into HTML@. The routine is
generally robust, but it works best if the source document is clean
\LaTeX~without a significant freight of local macros or \texttt{.sty}
files. Use of the source file \texttt{scifile.tex} as a template, and
calling \{\it only\/\} the \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files
specifically mentioned here, will generate a manuscript that should be
eminently reviewable, and yet will allow your paper to proceed quickly
into our production flow upon acceptance \cite{use2e}.

\hypertarget{formatting-citations}{%
\section{Formatting Citations}\label{formatting-citations}}

Citations can be handled in one of three ways. The most straightforward
(albeit labor-intensive) would be to hardwire your citations into your
\LaTeX~source, as you would if you were using an ordinary word
processor. Thus, your code might look something like this:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
However, this record of the solar nebula may have been
partly erased by the complex history of the meteorite
parent bodies, which includes collision-induced shock,
thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration
({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent Compiled, the last two lines of the code above, of course,
would give notecalls in \{\it Science\/\} style:

\begin{quote}
\ldots thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration ({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{quote}

Under the same logic, the author could set up his or her reference list
as a simple enumeration,

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei
and Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ 
Physik\/} {\bf 56}, 1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent yielding

\begin{quote}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and
Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ Physik} {\bf 56},
1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

That's not a solution that's likely to appeal to everyone, however ---
especially not to users of B\{\small\{IB\}\}\TeX~\cite{inclme}. If you
are a B\{\small\{IB\}\}\TeX~user, we suggest that you use the
\texttt{Science.bst} bibliography style file and the
\texttt{scicite.sty} package, both of which we are downloadable from our
author help site
(\url{http://www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/TeX_help/}). You can
also generate your reference lists by using the list environment
\texttt{\{thebibliography\}} at the end of your source document; here
again, you may find the \texttt{scicite.sty} file useful.

Whether you use B\{\small\{IB\}\}\TeX~or \texttt{\{thebibliography\}},
be very careful about how you set up your in-text reference calls and
notecalls. In particular, observe the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please follow the style for references outlined at our author
  help site and embodied in recent issues of {\it Science}.  Each
  citation number should refer to a single reference; please do not
  concatenate several references under a single number.
\item Please cite your references and notes in text {\it only\/} using
  the standard \LaTeX\ \verb+\cite+ command, not another command
  driven by outside macros.
\item Please separate multiple citations within a single \verb+\cite+
  command using commas only; there should be {\it no space\/}
  between reference keynames.  That is, if you are citing two
  papers whose bibliography keys are \texttt{keyname1} and
  \texttt{keyname2}, the in-text cite should read
  \verb+\cite{keyname1,keyname2}+, {\it not\/}
  \verb+\cite{keyname1, keyname2}+.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Failure to follow these guidelines could lead to the omission
of the references in an accepted paper when the source file is
translated to Word via HTML.

\hypertarget{handling-math-tables-and-figures}{%
\section{Handling Math, Tables, and
Figures}\label{handling-math-tables-and-figures}}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations, tables,
and figures for submission to \{\it Science\}.

\paragraph*{In-line math.}

The utility that we use for converting from \LaTeX~to HTML handles
in-line math relatively well. It is best to avoid using built-up
fractions in in-line equations, and going for the more boring
``slash'\,' presentation whenever possible --- that is, for \verb+$a/b$+
(which comes out as \(a/b\)) rather than \verb+$\frac{a}{b}$+ (which
compiles as \(\frac{a}{b}\)). Likewise, HTML isn't tooled to handle
certain overaccented special characters in-line; for \(\hat{\alpha}\)
(coded \verb+$\hat{\alpha}$+), for example, the HTML translation code
will return {[}\^{}\{\}\((\alpha)\){]}. Don't drive yourself crazy ---
but if it's possible to avoid such constructs, please do so. Please do
not code arrays or matrices as in-line math; display them instead. And
please keep your coding as \TeX-y as possible --- avoid using
specialized math macro packages like \texttt{amstex.sty}.

\paragraph*{Displayed math.}

Our HTML converter sets up \TeX\\
displayed equations using nested HTML tables. That works well for an
HTML presentation, but Word chokes when it comes across a nested table
in an HTML file. We surmount that problem by simply cutting the
displayed equations out of the HTML before it's imported into Word, and
then replacing them in the Word document using either images or
equations generated by a Word equation editor. Strictly speaking, this
procedure doesn't bear on how you should prepare your manuscript ---
although, for reasons best consigned to a note \cite{nattex}, we'd
prefer that you use native \TeX~commands within displayed-math
environments, rather than \LaTeX~sub-environments.

\paragraph*{Tables.}

The HTML converter that we use seems to handle reasonably well simple
tables generated using the \LaTeX\\
\texttt{\{tabular\}} environment. For very complicated tables, you may
want to consider generating them in a word processing program and
including them as a separate file.

\paragraph*{Figures.}

Figure callouts within the text should not be in the form of
\LaTeX~references, but should simply be typed in --- that is,
\verb+(Fig. 1)+ rather than \verb+\ref{fig1}+. For the figures
themselves, treatment can differ depending on whether the manuscript is
an initial submission or a final revision for acceptance and
publication. For an initial submission and review copy, you can use the
\LaTeX~\verb+{figure}+ environment and the \verb+\includegraphics+
command to include your PostScript figures at the end of the compiled
PostScript file. For the final revision, however, the \verb+{figure}+
environment should \{\it not\/\} be used; instead, the figure captions
themselves should be typed in as regular text at the end of the source
file (an example is included here), and the figures should be uploaded
separately according to the Art Department's instructions.

\hypertarget{what-to-send-in}{%
\section{What to Send In}\label{what-to-send-in}}

What you should send to \{\it Science\/\} will depend on the stage your
manuscript is in:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Important:} If you're sending in the initial submission of
  your manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
  please send in {\it only\/} a PostScript or PDF version of the
  compiled file (including figures).  Please do not send in the \TeX\ 
  source, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.bbl}, or other associated files with
  your initial submission.  (For more information, please see the
  instructions at our Web submission site,
  http://www.submit2science.org/ .)
\item When the time comes for you to send in your revised final
  manuscript (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include
  all source files and generated files in your upload.  Thus, if the
  name of your main source document is \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, you
  need to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.
\item \texttt{ltxfile.aux}, the auxilliary file generated by the
  compilation.
\item A PostScript file (compiled using \texttt{dvips} or some other
  driver) of the \texttt{.dvi} file generated from
  \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, or a PDF file distilled from that
  PostScript.  You do not need to include the actual \texttt{.dvi}
  file in your upload.
\item From B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ users, your bibliography (\texttt{.bib})
  file, {\it and\/} the generated file \texttt{ltxfile.bbl} created
  when you run B{\small{IB}}\TeX.
\item Any additional \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files called by
  the source code (though, for reasons noted earlier, we {\it
    strongly\/} discourage the use of such files beyond those
  mentioned in this document).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bibliography{scibib.bib}
\bibliographystyle{Science}

% Following is a new environment, {scilastnote}, that's defined in the
% preamble and that allows authors to add a reference at the end of the
% list that's not signaled in the text; such references are used in
% *Science* for acknowledgments of funding, help, etc.

\begin{scilastnote}
\item Please include your acknowledgments here, set in a single
paragraph.

% For your review copy (i.e., the file you initially send in for
% evaluation), you can use the {figure} environment and the
% \includegraphics command to stream your figures into the text, placing
% all figures at the end.  For the final, revised manuscript for
% acceptance and production, however, PostScript or other graphics
% should not be streamed into your compliled file.  Instead, set
% captions as simple paragraphs (with a \noindent tag), setting them

% submit figures as separate files according to the Art Department's

% \verb+\ref+ commands.  Instead, simply refer to the figure numbers in

% the end of the document, coded as ordinary paragraphs as shown in the
