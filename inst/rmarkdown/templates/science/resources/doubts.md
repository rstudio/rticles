1. Need a help to figure out how to create a pandoc template for the author's section
2. Is there a way to get Pandoc to render all images at the end? 
3. Problem is that they want figures rendered for the initial draft / peer review, but no figures included for the final version - 
- potential solution - get pandoc variable "figures:true" to decide if images should be included in the PDF or not
4. In which format does science want references? is there a custom csl file - There only appears to be Science.bst file?
