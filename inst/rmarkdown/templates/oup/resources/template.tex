\section{Introduction}


The introduction introduces the context and summarizes the manuscript. It is importantly to clearly state the contributions
of this piece of work. The potential offered to policy makers by data-driven research is greater than it ever has been.
Increasing volumes of data, faster technology, and evolving techniques and methodology enable us to process ever more data faster,
providing the opportunity to focus and evaluate policies to deliver more effectively and economically at a time when efficient use
of public money is paramount.

More data can now be analyzed faster enabling researchers to explore more and more complex interactions. Data across a wide spectrum from open data\footnote{\url{https://data.gov.uk/}} that can be downloaded, through licensed data,\footnote{\url{https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/}} to sensitive personal data can now contribute to our understanding of health, social, and economic outcomes.

The United Kingdom has a long tradition of safe data use by researchers. In the 50 years that the UK
Data Archive has been making data available for social and economic research, there have been no
damaging disclosures of personal information by academic researchers\footnote{That is not to say that there have been no breaches---researchers using data for a project they are not licensed for or passing data
to unlicensed colleagues---however, this, as far as we are aware of, has never caused harm to individuals or entities in the data.}. While increasing use of detailed and sometimes sensitive
data can contribute valuable insights for targeting policies, we cannot be
complacent. In order to support our policy needs and continue to use data safely and effectively, we
need a research infrastructure that protects data confidentiality while enabling researchers to undertake
innovative research.

\section{This is an example for first level head - section head}\label{sec2}

Once data are disseminated, whatever contractual or other obligations are placed on those receiving the
data, the data are effectively out of a data providers' control. Data providers must be certain that the data
disseminated do not provide a risk of disclosure necessitating a reduction in the detail available.
Data providers must be certain that the data disseminated do not provide a risk of disclosure necessitating
a reduction in the detail available, or they are constrained to using a resource intensive auditing regime,
and are likely to discover any data misuse only after it has happened (refer Section~\ref{sec5}).

A first step toward protecting sensitive data is to keep control of it, to disseminate access, not data. Data
providers internationally are increasing, moving toward systems in which researchers remotely accessed.



\section{Equations}\label{sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX{} can either be inline or on-a-line by itself. For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. Eg: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

For on-a-line by itself equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or eqnarray environments:
\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu\label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec3}).



\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables one has to 12pt use the additional ``tablenotes" environment
enclosing the tabular environment. The footnote appears just below the table
itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}).


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{<width>}
\caption{<table-caption>\label{<table-label>}}%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
column 1 & column 2 & column 3 & column 4\\
\midrule
row 1 & data 1 & data 2          & data 3 \\
row 2 & data 4 & data 5$^{1}$ & data 6 \\
row 3 & data 7 & data 8      & data 9$^{2}$\\
\botrule
\end{tabular}
\begin{tablenotes}%
\item Source: Example for source.
\item[$^{1}$] Example for a 1st table footnote.
\item[$^{2}$] Example for a 2nd table footnote.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}


Lengthy tables which doesn't fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, we need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of\break \verb+\begin{table}...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment.


\begin{table}[!t]

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards one has to use eps images for \verb+latex+ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for
\verb+pdflatex+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \verb+latex+
and \verb+pdflatex+. The images should be single page documents. The command for inserting images
for \verb+latex+ and \verb+pdflatex+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+latex/pdflatex+ is the
graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:


\begin{figure}[!t]%
\centering
{\color{black!20}\rule{213pt}{37pt}}
\caption{This is a widefig. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[!t]%
\centering
{\color{black!20}\rule{438pt}{74pt}}
\caption{This is a widefig. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}\label{fig2}
\end{figure*}


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering\includegraphics{<eps-file>}
        \caption{<figure-caption>}
        \label{<figure-label>}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

Test text here.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. Lengthy figures which doesn't fit in textwidth should be set as rotated mode. For rotated figures, we need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaysfigure}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaysfigure}+ instead of \verb+\begin{figure}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure}+ environment.

\begin{sidewaysfigure}%
\centering
{\color{black!20}\rule{610pt}{102pt}}
\caption{This is an example for sideways figure. This is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption  this is an example of long caption this is an example of long caption}\label{fig3}
\end{sidewaysfigure}



\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

Packages \verb+algorithm+, \verb+algorithmicx+ and \verb+algpseudocode+ are used for setting algorithms in latex.
For this, one has to use the below format:


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{<alg-caption>}\label{<alg-label>}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
. . .
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\end{verbatim}


We need to refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment.
To set program codes, one has to use \verb+program+, package. We need to use \verb+\begin{program}+ \verb+...+
\verb+\end{program}+ environment to set program codes. A fast exponentiation procedure:

\begin{algorithm}[!t]
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}\label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$
\State $y \Leftarrow 1$
\If{$n < 0$}
        \State $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow -n$
\Else
        \State $X \Leftarrow x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow n$
\EndIf
\While{$N \neq 0$}
        \If{$N$ is even}
            \State $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \Else[$N$ is odd]
            \State $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Similarly, for \verb+listings+, one has to use \verb+listings+ package. \verb+\begin{lstlisting}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{lstlisting}+ environment is used to set environments similar to \verb+verbatim+ environment. Refer \verb+lstlisting+, package documentation for more details on this.


\begin{minipage}{\hsize}%
\lstset{language=Pascal}% Set your language (you can change the language for each code-block optionally)
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,framexleftmargin=-1pt,framexrightmargin=-17pt,framesep=12pt,linewidth=0.98\textwidth]% Start your code-block
for i:=maxint to 0 do
begin
{ do nothing }
end;
Write('Case insensitive ');
Write('Pascal keywords.');
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}


\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation, align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments one should use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command.  One can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure \ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command
\verb+ Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}".

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec3}

With standard numerical .bst files, only numerical citations are possible.
With an author-year .bst file, both numerical and author-year citations are possible.

If author-year citations are selected, \verb+\bibitem+ must have one of the following forms:


{\footnotesize%
\begin{verbatim}
\bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)]{key}...
\bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)Jones,
                Baker, and Williams]{key}...
\bibitem[Jones et al., 1990]{key}...
\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Jones,
                Baker, and Williams}
                {Jones et al.}{1990}]{key}...
\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Jones et al.}
                {1990}]{key}...
\bibitem[\protect\astroncite{Jones et al.}
                {1990}]{key}...
\bibitem[\protect\citename{Jones et al., }
                1990]{key}...
\harvarditem[Jones et al.]{Jones, Baker, and
                Williams}{1990}{key}...
\end{verbatim}}


This is either to be made up manually, or to be generated by an
appropriate .bst file with BibTeX. Then,


{%
\begin{verbatim}
                    Author-year mode
                        || Numerical mode
\citet{key} ==>>  Jones et al. (1990)
                        || Jones et al. [21]
\citep{key} ==>> (Jones et al., 1990) || [21]
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent
Multiple citations as normal:


{%
\begin{verbatim}
\citep{key1,key2} ==> (Jones et al., 1990;
                         Smith, 1989)||[21,24]
        or (Jones et al., 1990, 1991)||[21,24]
        or (Jones et al., 1990a,b)   ||[21,24]
\end{verbatim}}


\noindent
\verb+\cite{key}+ is the equivalent of \verb+\citet{key}+ in author-year mode
and  of \verb+\citep{key}+ in numerical mode. Full author lists may be forced with
\verb+\citet*+ or \verb+\citep*+, e.g.

\section{Lists}\label{sec9}

List in \LaTeX{} can be of three types: numbered, bulleted and unnumbered. ``enumerate'' environment produces numbered list,
``itemize'' environment produces bulleted list and ``unlist'' environment produces unnumbered list.
In each environments, new entry is added via the \verb+\item+ command.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item This is the 1st item

\item Enumerate creates numbered lists, itemize creates bulleted lists and
unnumerate creates unnumbered lists.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Second level numbered list. Enumerate creates numbered lists, itemize creates bulleted lists and
description creates unnumbered lists.

\item Second level numbered list. Enumerate creates numbered lists, itemize creates bulleted lists and
