# Introduction {-}
Cite fancy references [@Neuro2013]. As demonstrated in @Gene2012, citations can
also be automatically reference. Multiple references are separated by semicolons
[@Neuro2013; @Neurobot2013].

# Results {-}

<!-- Comments should be HTML-style comments -->

## Subsection 1 {-}

You can use `R` chunks directly to plot graphs.  

```{r graph, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.show = "hide"}
x <- 0:100
set.seed(999)
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
plot(x, y)
```

## Subsection 2 {-}

Frontiers requires figures to be submitted individually, in the same order as
they are referred to in the manuscript. Figures will then be automatically
embedded at the bottom of the submitted manuscript. Kindly ensure that each
table and figure is mentioned in the text and in numerical order. Permission
must be obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including
the web). Please note that it is compulsory to follow figure instructions.
Figures which are not according to the guidelines will cause substantial delay
during the production process.

# Discussion

# Disclosure/Conflict-of-Interest Statement {-}

<!--  
Frontiers follows the recommendations by the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/ethical_4conflicts.html) which require
that all financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by
the academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be
disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to declare that
the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial
relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. When
disclosing the potential conflict of interest, the authors need to address the
following points:

 - Did you or your institution at any time receive payment or services from a
   third party for any aspect of the submitted work?
 - Please declare financial relationships with entities that could be perceived
   to influence, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what
   you wrote in the submitted work.
 - Please declare patents and copyrights, whether pending, issued, licensed
   and/or receiving royalties relevant to the work.
 - Please state other relationships or activities that readers could perceive to
   have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what
   you wrote in the submitted work.
 -->

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any
commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential
conflict of interest.

# Author Contributions {-}

<!--  

When determining authorship the following criteria should be observed:

 - Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the
   acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
 - Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual
   content; AND
 - Final approval of the version to be published ; AND
 - Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that
   questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are
   appropriately investigated and resolved.

Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of the above criteria for authorship
should not be listed as authors, but they should be acknowledged.
(http://www.icmje.org/roles_a.html)

-->

The statement about the authors and contributors can be up to several sentences
long, describing the tasks of individual authors referred to by their initials
and should be included at the end of the manuscript before the References
section.

# Supplemental Data 

Supplementary Material should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are
Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same file as the
figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material templates can be found in the Frontiers
LaTeX folder

# References

A reference list should be automatically created here. However it won't. Pandoc 
will place the list of references at the end of the document instead. There are 
no convenient solution for now to force Pandoc to do otherwise. The easiest way 
to get around this problem is to edit the LaTeX file created by Pandoc before 
compiling it again using the traditional LaTeX commands.

# Figures {-}

```{r, Figure-1, ref.label = "graph", results = "hide", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure caption', out.width = "85mm", out.height = "85mm"}
# You can also refer to code chunks from above to place figures at the bottom.
```
