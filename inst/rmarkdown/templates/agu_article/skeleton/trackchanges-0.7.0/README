
TrackChanges
Multiple editors in LaTeX.
========================================================================

INTRODUCTION:

  The TrackChanges package consists of two parts:
  1.  A LaTex style file: 
        trackchanges.sty
  2.  A GUI, written in python:
         trackchanges.py

  The style file may be used without the GUI.  The GUI is to be used to
  facilitate accepting, rejecting, or modifying the edits made using the
  commands defined in the style file.

  This packages also includes a command line utility: acceptchanges.py.
  This utility will only work in posix environments.

  Help files are available as part of this package:
    ./documentation/web/help.html

  Documentation is also  available at the TrackChanges website.

TRACKCHANGES GUI

  This is a Beta version of the TrackChanges GUI. 
  That means: Beware! Bugs may lurk ahead.

  If you choose to use this software plese be careful to back up your 
  TeX files.  This software has not been thoroughly tested and may
  corrupt your TeX files.  (The style file is fine and can't mess any
  thing up but the GUI for accepting/rejecting/modifying might.)
