<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

Very sorry?

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Yes, sir. It was a very very bad thing to have done and I'm really very
ashamed of myself. I can only say it won't happen again. To have
murdered so many people in such a short space of time is really awful,
and I really am very, very, very sorry that I did it, and also that I've
taken up so much of the court's valuable time listening to the sordid
details of these senseless killings of mine. I would particularly like
to say, a very personal and sincere 'sorry' to you, m'lud, for my
appalling behaviour throughout this trial. I'd also like to say sorry to
the police, for putting them to so much trouble (shot of three heavily
bandaged exhausted-looking policemen behind him) for the literally hours
of work they've had to put in, collecting evidence and identifying
corpses and so forth. You know I think sometimes we ought to realize the
difficult and often dangerous work involved in tracking down violent
criminals like myself and I'd just like them to know that their fine
work is at least appreciated by me.

No, no, no, no.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

It's very good of you to say that, but I know what you've been through.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ First Policeman:

No, no, we've had worse.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

I know and I'm grateful. I'd like to apologize too to the prosecuting
counsel for dragging him in here morning after morning in such lovely
weather.

<span class="hl kwa">\remove</span>[ym]<span class="hl sym">{</span><span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Counsel:

Well, I would have had to come in anyway.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Ah good, but what a presentation of a case!

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Counsel:

Oh thank you.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

No, no, it's a privilege to watch you in action. I never had a chance.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Counsel:

Oh yes you did.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Not after that summing up. Great.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Counsel:

Oh thank you. (very chuffed)<span class="hl sym">}</span>

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

And now I must come to the jury. What can I say. I've dragged you in
here, day after day, keeping you away from your homes, your jobs, your
loved ones, just to hear the private details of my petty atrocities.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Foreman:

No, no, it was very <span class="hl kwa">\change</span><span class="hl sym">{</span>interesting<span class="hl sym">}{</span>fascinating<span class="hl sym">}</span>.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

But you could have had a much nicer case.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Foreman:

No, no, murder's much more fun.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ First Juryman:

Yes and so many of them.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Second Juryman:

Excellent.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Third Juryman:

We've had a terrific time. (the jury applauds)

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

(blows his nose, does a Dickie Attenborough) I'm sorry, I'm very moved.
 And so, m'lud, it only remains for you to pass the most savage sentence
 on me that the law can provide.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

Well er... not necessarily.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

No, m'lud, the full penalty of the law is hardly sufficient. I insist I
must be made an example of.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

Well yes and no. I mean society at large...

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Oh no, m'lud. Not with mass murder.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

But in this case, (to court) don't you think?

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Court:

Yes, yes!

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Oh, come on, m'lud, you've got to give me life.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Court:

No, no, no, no.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

(to court at large) Well, ten years at least.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

Ten years!

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Court:

Shame. Shame!

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Well five then. Be fair.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

No, no. I'm giving you three months.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Oh no, that's so embarrassing. I won't hear of it. Give me six...please.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

Well, all right. Six months.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Randall:

Thank you, m'lud.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Judge:

But suspended.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\  Randall:

Oh no.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Court:

Hooray. (they applaud)

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Foreman:

Three cheers for the defendant. Hip. Hip.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Court:

Hooray.

<span class="hl kwa">\noindent</span>\\ Voice <span class="hl kwa">\emph</span><span class="hl sym">{</span>(off)<span class="hl sym">}</span>:

Which nobody can deny.
