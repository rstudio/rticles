Please make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the 
Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to 
typeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, 
unless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.

For detailed instructions regarding the elsevier article class, see   [https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/latex-instructions).


# Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: @Feynman1963118 [@Dirac1953888].

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style. 
The style can be changed using the `layout` option in the header.

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at
\url{https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files}. 
To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

If `citation_package` is set to `default`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`.
In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. Alternative `csl` files
are available from https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier. These can be downloaded
and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.
