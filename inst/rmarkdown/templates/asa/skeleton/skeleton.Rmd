# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a ASA article.
It is built from template find at Journal of the American Statistical Association [instruction for authors](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?show=instructions&journalCode=uasa20#formatting)

## Plot

Plot example - LaTeX floating to be adjusted if you don't want it.

```{r, fig.cap = "A plot example", echo = FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Table

Table example

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

## Various guidelines

- Note that figures and tables should appear in the paper, not at the end or
in separate files.
- Remember that in the blind version, you should not identify authors indirectly in the text.  That is, don't say "In Smith et. al.  (2009) we showed that ...".  Instead, say "Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...".
- These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements. Please refer to the instructions for authors
at <http://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=uasa20&page=instructions#.VFkk7fnF_0c>
- For more about ASAÂ style, please see <http://journals.taylorandfrancis.com/amstat/asa-style-guide/>
- If you have supplementary material (e.g., software, data, technical proofs), identify them in the section below.  In early stages of the submission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary material.  Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at later stages.

# Methods {#meth}

Don't take any of these section titles seriously.  They're just for illustration.

# Verifications {#verify}

This section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of
text looks like, for margins and spacing.
