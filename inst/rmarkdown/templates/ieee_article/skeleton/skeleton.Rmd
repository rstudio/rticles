Introduction
=============
<!-- no \IEEEPARstart -->
This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE conference papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
<!-- You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter -->
<!-- (should never be an issue) -->
I wish you the best of success.


## Subsection Heading Here
Subsection text here.

### Subsubsection Heading Here
Subsubsection text here.

<!-- An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package. -->
<!-- Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption. -->
<!-- For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics. -->
<!-- Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that -->
<!-- is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption -->
<!-- even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because -->
<!-- of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your -->
<!-- \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}. -->

<!-- Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class -->
<!-- option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be -->
<!-- displayed while in draft mode. -->

<!-- \begin{figure}[!t] -->
<!-- \centering -->
<!-- \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure} -->
<!-- where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,  -->
<!-- and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared -->
<!-- via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions. -->
<!-- \caption{Simulation results for the network.} -->
<!-- \label{fig_sim} -->
<!-- \end{figure} -->

<!-- Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this -->
<!-- results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats. -->


<!-- An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures. -->
<!-- (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.) -->
<!-- The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, -->
<!-- and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption. -->
<!-- \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing. -->
<!-- Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a  -->
<!-- line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur. -->

<!-- \begin{figure*}[!t] -->
<!-- \centering -->
<!-- \subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}% -->
<!-- \label{fig_first_case}} -->
<!-- \hfil -->
<!-- \subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}% -->
<!-- \label{fig_second_case}} -->
<!-- \caption{Simulation results for the network.} -->
<!-- \label{fig_sim} -->
<!-- \end{figure*} -->

<!-- Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure -->
<!-- captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will -->
<!-- reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption. -->
<!-- Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure -->
<!-- labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a -->
<!-- subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank, -->
<!-- e.g., \subfloat[]. -->


<!-- An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the -->
<!-- \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table -->
<!-- captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words -->
<!-- such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to -->
<!-- and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or -->
<!-- last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as -->
<!-- the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables. -->
<!-- The \label must come after \caption as always. -->

<!-- \begin{table}[!t] -->
<!-- % increase table row spacing, adjust to taste -->
<!-- \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3} -->
<!-- if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of -->
<!-- \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells -->
<!-- \caption{An Example of a Table} -->
<!-- \label{table_example} -->
<!-- \centering -->
<!-- % Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables -->
<!-- % than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here. -->
<!-- \begin{tabular}{|c||c|} -->
<!-- \hline -->
<!-- One & Two\\ -->
<!-- \hline -->
<!-- Three & Four\\ -->
<!-- \hline -->
<!-- \end{tabular} -->
<!-- \end{table} -->


<!-- Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column -->
<!-- - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, -->
<!-- in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it -->
<!-- is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but -->
<!-- not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use -->
<!-- top floats exclusively.  -->
<!-- Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places -->
<!-- footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the -->
<!-- \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package. -->


Conclusion
============
The conclusion goes here.

<!-- conference papers do not normally have an appendix -->
