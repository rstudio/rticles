abstract: |
  The Transportation Research Board (TRB) has unique and seemingly arbitrary requirements for manuscripts submitted for review. These requirements make it difficult to write the manuscripts quickly, and no existing \LaTeX\ style comes close to fooling the guidelines. This represents an initial effort at creating a template to meet the requirements of TRB authors using \LaTeX, R, Sweave, and/or other literate programming software.

# Transportation Research Board Annual Meetings

TRB has greatly simplified the submissions to its system, meaning that this
template is no longer strictly required. However, there is a typical format
that most people still use by default, and this template implements that change.


# Features

The template has a number of features that enable quick and painless manuscript authoring.

## Mathematics

Standard pandoc / \LaTeX math environments are available.  For example, the
probability of an individual choosing alternative $i$ in a multinomial logit
model is
\begin{equation}
  P_i = \frac{exp(V_i)}{\sum_{i, j \in J}exp(V_j)} \label{eq:mnl}
\end{equation}
Equations with a `\label{eq:label}` can be referred to later in the text with
`\ref{eq:label}`, such as Equation \ref{eq:mnl}.

## Title Page

The template will automatically create a title page with the authors in the
listed order.  Near the bottom of the title page, TRB requires a count of the manuscript's
words and tables. The YAML header information contains a `wordcount` key where
this can be encoded. The number of tables is counted automatically on build; 
a default 250 words per table can be overriden with the `wordspertable` YAML
key.

The LaTeX template available from <https://github.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_tex>
contain automatic word counters that have not been implemented in this `rticles`
template. Authors can use the R Studio word count add-in available from
<https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin>.

## Page Layout

The document has 1 inch margins as required, with the author's names in the left
heading and the page number in the right. The running header information is set
with the `runningheader` YAML key. Paragraphs leading sections and subsections
are not indented, while all subsequent paragraphs in that section are. Section
heading types are defined as outlined by the old TRB Author's Guide.

The document is single-spaced in 12 point Times font. Times New Roman is a
proprietary font and is therefore not available by installation in open-source
software. While the differences between Times variants are negligible, Times New
Roman itself can be used in Mac OSX by compiling under `xelatex`.

## Figure and Table references

The document can use standard pandoc referencing tools for in-text
citations to figures and tables. If an R code chunk outputs a figure, the figure
number can be referred to with `\@ref(fig:chunkname)` where `chunkname` is the
name of the chunk that prints the figure.  For example, Figure \@ref(fig:figure-example)
shows a default figure made by the R chunk below.

```{r figure-example, fig.cap="Generic plot.", echo = TRUE}
# Generate some sample data, then compute mean and standard deviation
# in each group
Speed <- cars$speed
Distance <- cars$dist
plot(Speed, Distance,
     panel.first = lines(stats::lowess(Speed, Distance), lty = "dashed"),
     pch = 0, cex = 1.2, col = "blue")
```

The template setup chunk sets `echo = FALSE` for the entire document, as printing
code listings would not usually be appropriate or needed for a TRB article. But
the option is there!

The same referencing logic works for tables, with the `tab:` prefix on the
chunk name instead of `fig:` used for figures. Table \@ref(tab:table-example)
has a basic table. We recommend the `kableExtra` package for formatting 
publication-ready tables with greater control than the default `knitr::kable()`
function.

```{r table-example}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:6], format = "latex", table.envir = "table", 
             booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Example Table") 
```


## Bibliography styles

TRB still wants numbered, unsorted citations beginning on a new page. The
template is configured to use `natbib` with the `unsrtnat` citation style, with
some additional logic to use parentheses instead of brackets. The YAML key
`bibliostyle` will allow the authors to select a different citation format, but
this is not recommended at the moment. Citations use the pandoc logic. Including
the reference in brackets `[@reference]` will print only the numeric reference;
e.g. [@Feynman1963118; @Dirac1953888]. Including the reference without brackets
`@reference` will print the authors and then the numeric reference; e.g.
@Feynman1963118.

# Author Contribution Statement

The authors confirm contribution to the paper as follows: study conception and
design: A. Anonymous, D. Zoolander; data collection: B. Security; analysis and
interpretation of results: A. Anonymous, B. Security; draft manuscript
preparation: A. Anonymous. All authors reviewed the results and approved
the final version of the manuscript.

# Acknowledgements

David Pritchard posted the original versions of this template in 2009 and
updated it in 2011, soon after TRB began allowing PDF submissions. Gregory
Macfarlane and Ross Wang made adjustments to the template, and Ross Wang now
maintains the \LaTeX template at
<https://github.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_tex>. Gregory Macfarlane created the `rticles` template in 2021.
