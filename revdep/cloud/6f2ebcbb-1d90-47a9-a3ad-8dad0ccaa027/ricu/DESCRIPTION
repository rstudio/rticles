Package: ricu
Title: Intensive Care Unit Data with R
Description: Focused on (but not exclusive to) data sets hosted on PhysioNet
    (<https://physionet.org>), 'ricu' provides utilities for download, setup
    and access of intensive care unit (ICU) data sets. In addition to
    functions for running arbitrary queries against available data sets, a
    system for defining clinical concepts and encoding their representations
    in tabular ICU data is presented.
